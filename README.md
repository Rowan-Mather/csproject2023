# csproject2023: ARchae

A 3rd year dissertation project. This is a Unity app that imports 3D models (sites) into your virtual world and lets you walk around them. 
This is designed primarily for archaeological purposes, so you can visualise ancient locations as they once were on the modern site.

Find in this repo all my code, some sample sites and the documentation. Wish me luck!
